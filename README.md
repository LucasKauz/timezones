The main goal of this product is to make the gap between remote workers with different time zones and a company that needs their services.

## Definitions

local: base timezone to compare with (eg. where you are working from)
working hours: 9am to 17pm
target: the place to compare to (eg. where the company you want to work to is)
overlap: the amount of hours an user is able to work on target working hours
